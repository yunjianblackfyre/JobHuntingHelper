1.New word extraction
    The input of new word extraction, comes from DB directly. More specifically, Field "Fjob_detail"
    Every job_detail is submitted under these preprocess rules:
        Replace all continues white space mark(\s+) with one white space
        Replace all puntuations with one white space
        Replace all stop words with one white space
        Mapping some special words
    When new word extraction is running, There are things you need to be careful about:
        existed words in Jieba will be filtered
        existed words in FULL_STOP_WORDS will be filtered
        new word that does not satisfy free_level or sld_level threshold condition will be filtered
        new word that is too long or too short will be filtered
        all english words will be ignored
    When new word finding process is done, a json txt file that store a dict(new_word:its_freq)
    can be found by path "./new_words/new_words.txt"
    
    The final step of new word extraction is human sensorship.
    After the final refined new word file is created(still a json file),
    Change file format from json to txt file like this: 
        new_word_1 13962 vn
        new_word_2 13962 vn
        new_word_3 13962 vn
        ...... (new_word, its_freq, word_tag)
    Later, Jieba can read this file, and add all the new words into its training corpus
    (When you get back home, rerun new word extraction)
